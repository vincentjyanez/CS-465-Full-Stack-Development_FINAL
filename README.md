# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development_FINAL
Architecture
In this project, I used Express for the backend, HTML for the structure, JavaScript for interactivity, and MongoDB as the database.

Frontend (HTML, JavaScript, SPA): HTML is used for basic structure, JavaScript adds interactivity, and SPA allows for dynamic content without refreshing the page.
Backend (MongoDB): MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible format, making it easy to scale and handle varying data types.

Functionality
JSON vs. JavaScript:
JSON is a data format used to store and share data, while JavaScript is a programming language that manipulates data. JSON is used to send data between the frontend and backend, while JavaScript works with the data on the frontend.

Refactoring for Improved Functionality:
I improved code by making parts of the interface reusable, like trip cards.(*NOTE: got this to work once and never saw it again lol) This saved time and made the code easier to update. I also made database queries more efficient to speed up the app.

Benefits of Reusable UI Components:
Reusable UI components help keep the design consistent and make it easier to update the app without rewriting the same code over and over.

Testing
Methods and Endpoints:
Methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE help manage data. Endpoints are URLs like /api/trips that the frontend uses to interact with the backend.

Security in Testing:
Security ensures only authorized users can access or change data. Testing checks that users are logged in and can only access what they're allowed to.

Reflection
This course has helped me develop essential skills in full-stack development, which are directly applicable to my professional goals. I learned to build both frontend and backend applications using technologies like Express, MongoDB, and JavaScript, improving my ability to create dynamic websites. The hands-on experience with APIs, databases, and security practices has made me more marketable as a developer. Although I wasn't able to fully implement the security practices code, I gained a deeper understanding of how security works in full-stack applications. These skills enhance my ability to contribute to projects from start to finish, making me a more well-rounded candidate in the tech industry.
